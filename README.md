# NAFLD Prediction App

🚀 **NAFLD Prediction App** is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the probability of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (НАЖБП) using a trained Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model.

## 📌 Features
- **User Input Fields**: Enter various health parameters.
- **Prediction Model**: Uses a trained **EBM model** (`ebm_model.pkl`) for classification.
- **Probability Output**: Displays the likelihood of NAFLD.
- **Visual Comparison**: A graph showing user values vs. normal ranges.
